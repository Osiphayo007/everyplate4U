# everyplate4U
Weekend e-commerce throwaway project (still debugging)

Everyplate4U stands as a subscription service devoted to UKZN students living within the Durban campuses and surrounding areas with its business premises in Durban. Meals from Monday to Friday/Saturday at the café are available through weekly and monthly subscriptions that present a range of meat and non-vegan and vegetarian options. Students can access the café through an e-commerce website to subscribe to services while customizing their orders and monitoring their account details through the online interface. This business provides predictable yet nutritious meals through subscription plans designed to serve the student population whose schedules are highly busy.
